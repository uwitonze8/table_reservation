Restaurant Table Reservation System

Project Overview
The Restaurant Table Reservation System is a web-based application developed to simplify and automate the process of reserving restaurant tables. It enables customers to view real-time table availability, make reservations, modify or cancel bookings, and receive confirmation and reminder notifications. On the administrative side, restaurant staff can efficiently manage tables, reservations, menus, and booking schedules through a dedicated admin interface.
The project follows a structured Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach to ensure system quality, feasibility, scalability, and maintainability.

Project Objectives
- Reduce manual and phone-based table reservations
- Prevent overbooking and scheduling conflicts
- Improve customer experience through real-time availability
- Enable restaurants to manage reservations efficiently
- Provide a scalable and extensible reservation platform
